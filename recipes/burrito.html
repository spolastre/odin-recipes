  <p>Do you love Chipotle, but you're tired of paying for carry-out? This is truly the easiest burrito recipe to make at home -- and they're freezer-friendly! Keep a stash in your kitchen and you can satisfying your Mexican food cravings any night of the week.</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>

    <li>1 lb. lean ground beef</li>
     <li> 1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups refried beans (or 1 ½ cups drained and rinsed black beans)</li>
    <li> ¾ cup corn kernels</li>
    <li>3 cups cooked rice (I like to use Uncle Ben's microwaveable Ready Rice for a quick option)</li>
    <li>6 large (10-inch) flour tortillas (I like to use Mission brand "burrito size" tortillas)</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>Optional garnish: finely diced red onion; lettuce; diced tomato or salsa; sour cream; fresh cilantro; avocado or guacamole</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350° F. Spray 9 x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside.</li>
    <li>Cook beef with taco seasoning mix, according to seasoning package instructions.</li>
    <li>To prepare 1 burrito: spread ¼ cup beans down center of tortillas; top with ½ cup rice, beef, 2 tablespoons corn, and ¼ cup cheese.</li>
    <li>Fold in opposite sides of each tortilla, then roll up, burrito style. Place, seam-sides down, in prepared dish. Repeat with remaining ingredients to prepare 6 total burritos.</li>
    <li>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes (until heated through). If you are baking the burritos from the refrigerator while they’re still cold, it will take about 30-35 minutes for them to heat through.</li>

    
  </ol>
